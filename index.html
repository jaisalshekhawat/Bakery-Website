      <p class="sectionSubTag text-sml">If you’ve ever tried making your own, you will appreciate how much work goes into making these flaky, buttery breakfast treats. 
        The dough is rolled, dotted with butter, folded and rolled again several times over in a process called laminating before being formed into the croissant (crescent) shape. 
        Developed from its Austrian forebear, the kipferi, no continental breakfast is complete without a croissant, served with fruit-laden jam and strong coffee.</p>
